## Projects

### [TP1 - ThreeJS Basics](tp1)
  Our living room features a table with a birthday cake, a slice of the cake, two plates, and two forks. Festive balloons adorn the room. A spotlight focuses on the cake, and there are four chairs around the table. In one corner, a large vase holds four flowers.

  The back wall has a window with an outside view, while the right side has a sitting area with two armchairs, four pillows, a coffee table with a newspaper and a spiral spring. In the right back corner, a vinyl plays atop its holder, with the cover on a small shelf.

  The room is adorned with paintings and photos, and well-illuminated with various light sources.
